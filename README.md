# Small Stuff

Just some small scripts etc. that might help people ecountering the same problems I do.

### changeDelimiterCSV
Python script that converts CSV files that use semicolon as delimiters to comma. Excel and Windows in particular are really annoying because one needs to change the language settings to be able to export with comma as delimiter.
